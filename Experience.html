        My SSB (SkillSandbox) experience was fun and hard, especially after our
        work immersion. We're still working on a task for SSB called "pay it
        back projects," and one of those is a big event that will be attended by
        120+ people this coming Saturday, May 19, 2024. But of course, because
        of SSB, I was also able to meet a lot of kind and hardworking people and
        mentors who will always help me. Also, because of those people, my
        Fridays became more fun and exciting. SSB also helped me hone my
        technical and soft skills, which is a big help for me to be ready for my
        future career path. SSB will always have a place in my heart, and I will
        not forget about my experiences that helped me become a better version
        of myself.
