          I, <b>John Nathan S. Neri </b> created this website for our quiz in
          ETEC. I was born on the fourteenth of November in the year 2005 in the
          Town of Pagsanjan, Province of Laguna. I studied primary education at
          Maulawin Elementary School until grade 4 and completed grade 5 and
          grade 6 at Navarro Elementary School. I continued my junior high
          school at St. Edward School, Imus Campus and am currently studying in
          the twelfth grade at St. Edward School, Faith Campus. In addition to
          my academic pursuits, I have a variety of interests, including frogs,
          penguins, cats, mangas, anime, video games, sleeping, eating, and
          more.
